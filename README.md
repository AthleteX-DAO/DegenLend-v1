# DegenLend-v1

DegenLend is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on the SX Network Testnet. It allows users to lend and borrow assets like **Wrapped SX (WSX)** and **USDC**, leveraging their supplied assets as collateral. DegenLend is designed to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts to earn interest on their deposits and take out loans while managing risk via collateralization.

## Overview

The **DegenLend Markets Page** provides users with an intuitive interface to interact with the lending protocol, enabling the following functionalities:
- **Supply and Borrow**: Users can supply their assets (WSX and USDC) and earn interest or borrow against their collateral.
- **Collateral Management**: Users can toggle supplied assets to be used as collateral.
- **Net APY and Borrow Limit**: The interface calculates and displays the user's net APY, borrow limit, and other key financial metrics.

The project is currently hosted on **IPFS** and deployed on the **SX Network Testnet**.
